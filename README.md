# Quantum-Secure-Image-Encryption-Software
This project introduces a prototype Quantum-Secure Image Encryption System designed with a triple-layered security architecture that combines simulated Quantum Key Distribution (BB84), image-based steganography, and message-length authentication. The system generates quantum-inspired shared keys using Qiskit and securely embeds encrypted text into the least-significant bits of RGB pixel values. The model ensures that any incorrect key regeneration or mismatched message length produces unintelligible output, making the encryption practically unbreakable without knowledge of all three security layers. Developed using Python, Qiskit, Pillow, and NumPy, this system demonstrates a next-generation encryption approach capable of resisting classical and quantum computational attacks, showcasing its strong potential for secure communication applications in real-world scenarios.
