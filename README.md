# Quantum-Secure-Image-Encryption-Software
A prototype Quantum-Secure Image Encryption System using triple-layer security: simulated QKD (BB84), image steganography, and message-length authentication. Built with Python, Qiskit, Pillow, and NumPy, it ensures strong resistance against classical and quantum attacks.
